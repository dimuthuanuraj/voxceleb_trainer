## Activities

### Saturday, October 26

**Testing with Different max_test_pairs Values:**

1. **Full Validation (553k pairs):**
   - Time: 6.8 minutes
   - Most accurate EER
   - Used for final model evaluation

2. **Quick Validation (10k pairs):**
   - Time: 4.2 minutes
   - Good for rapid iteration
   - Minor EER difference (~0.1-0.2%)

3. **Ultra-Quick (1k pairs):**
   - Time: 24 seconds
   - Very rough estimate
   - Useful for debugging only

**Findings:**
- 10k pairs provides good balance
- Recommended for daily training
- Full validation for final checkpoints

### Sunday, October 27

**Planning Next Steps:**

1. **Mini Dataset Creation:**
   - Need smaller dataset for rapid experiments
   - Target: 140 speakers (vs 5991)
   - Purpose: Quick model architecture testing

2. **Training Configuration:**
   - Review nPerSpeaker parameter
   - Document current best practices
   - Create comprehensive training guide

3. **Future Optimizations:**
   - Mixed precision training (FP16)
   - Gradient accumulation
   - Learning rate scheduling refinements

**Documentation Needs:**
- Complete training guide
- Mini dataset setup instructions
- Parameter tuning recommendations

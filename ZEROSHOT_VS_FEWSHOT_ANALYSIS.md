# Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot Learning Analysis for Speaker Verification

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Current System Analysis**

---

## 🔍 Is Your Current Setup Zero-Shot or Few-Shot?

### **Answer: Your current setup is ZERO-SHOT** ✅

---

## 📊 How to Identify Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot

### **Evidence from Your System:**

#### 1. **Speaker Disjoint Test Set**
```bash
# Training speakers (VoxCeleb2):
id00084, id00332, id00353, id00389, id00412, id00414, ...
# Range: id00XXX to id01XXX

# Test speakers (VoxCeleb1):  
id10014, id10052, id10055, id10062, id10066, id10089, ...
# Range: id10XXX to id11XXX

# Overlap: NONE (0 speakers) ✅
```

**Key Finding:** Training speakers (VoxCeleb2) and test speakers (VoxCeleb1) are **completely disjoint**.

---

#### 2. **Evaluation Method Analysis**

Your `evaluateFromList` function:
```python
def evaluateFromList(self, test_list, test_path, ...):
    # Reads test pairs: "0/1 speaker1/audio1.wav speaker2/audio2.wav"
    # Extracts embeddings for each audio
    # Computes cosine similarity
    # No model updates during test
    # No adaptation to test speakers
```

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Fixed model (no fine-tuning)
- ✅ Direct embedding extraction
- ✅ Cosine similarity comparison
- ✅ No speaker enrollment required
- ✅ No adaptation to test speakers

**Conclusion:** This is **ZERO-SHOT** evaluation.

---

#### 3. **Loss Function Analysis**

Current: **AAMSoftmax**
```python
class AAMSoftmax(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, margin=0.2, scale=30, nClasses=5994, ...):
        # Classification-based loss
        # Learns discriminative embeddings
        # Trained to separate nClasses speakers
```

**AAMSoftmax Behavior:**
- Trains on `nClasses` speakers (e.g., 140 or 5994)
- Learns general speaker discriminative features
- At test time: Uses learned embeddings (no classifier)
- Generalizes to unseen speakers via embedding space

**This is ZERO-SHOT by design** ✅

---

## 🎯 Definitions & Distinctions

### **Zero-Shot Learning (Your Current Setup)**

**Definition:**
- Train on speakers A, B, C, D, E
- Test on **completely unseen** speakers X, Y, Z
- No examples from test speakers during training
- No adaptation during inference

**How it Works:**
1. Train model to extract discriminative embeddings
2. Learn general speaker characteristics
3. At test: Extract embeddings for new speakers
4. Compare embeddings using distance/similarity

**Your Setup:**
```
Training: VoxCeleb2 speakers (id00XXX - id01XXX)
Testing:  VoxCeleb1 speakers (id10XXX - id11XXX)
Method:   Extract embeddings → Compute similarity → Threshold
Result:   Zero-shot speaker verification
```

---

### **Few-Shot Learning (Alternative Approach)**

**Definition:**
- Train on speakers A, B, C, D, E
- Test on **unseen** speakers X, Y, Z
- Given **K examples** (shots) per test speaker during evaluation
- Typical: K = 1 (one-shot), K = 5 (five-shot)

**How it Works:**
1. Train model with few-shot loss (Prototypical, GE2E, etc.)
2. At test: Given K support samples per speaker
3. Build speaker prototypes from support set
4. Classify query samples by distance to prototypes

**Example Few-Shot Scenario:**
```
Training: 5000 speakers, many utterances each
Testing:  100 NEW speakers
          - Support set: 5 utterances per speaker (5-shot)
          - Query set: Remaining utterances to verify
          
Task: Given 5 examples of speaker X, verify if new audio is also speaker X
```

---

### **Key Differences**

| Aspect | Zero-Shot (Your Setup) | Few-Shot |
|--------|----------------------|----------|
| **Test speakers** | Completely unseen | Unseen, but K examples given |
| **Enrollment** | Not required | Required (K support samples) |
| **Loss function** | AAMSoftmax, Triplet | Prototypical, GE2E, Matching Networks |
| **Inference** | Direct embedding comparison | Prototype-based classification |
| **Use case** | Open-set verification | Closed-set identification + verification |
| **Flexibility** | Can verify any pair | Need enrollment per new speaker |
| **Performance** | Good generalization | Better with support samples |

## 🔄 Converting to Few-Shot Learning

### **Available Few-Shot Loss Functions in Your Codebase**

#### 1. **Prototypical Networks** (`proto.py`)
```yaml
trainfunc: proto
nPerSpeaker: 2  # Minimum for prototypical
```

**How it Works:**
- Computes class prototypes (mean of embeddings)
- Classifies based on distance to nearest prototype
- Natural few-shot learner

**Best for:**
- Few examples per class
- Quick adaptation to new speakers
- Small datasets

**Training:**
```python
# Prototypical loss expects:
# x shape: [batch_size, nPerSpeaker, embedding_dim]
# Computes: prototype = mean(x[:, 1:, :])  # Support samples
#          query = x[:, 0, :]              # Query sample
#          distance = pairwise_distance(query, prototypes)
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Naturally handles few-shot
- ✅ No fixed number of classes needed
- ✅ Fast inference
- ✅ Good for small datasets

**Disadvantages:**
- ⚠️ May underperform on large-scale datasets
- ⚠️ Requires nPerSpeaker ≥ 2

---

#### 2. **GE2E (Generalized End-to-End)** (`ge2e.py`)
```yaml
trainfunc: ge2e
nPerSpeaker: 3  # Recommended minimum
init_w: 10.0
init_b: -5.0
```

**How it Works:**
- Computes speaker centroids
- Uses cosine similarity to centroids
- Learns scaling parameters (w, b)
- Designed for speaker verification

**Best for:**
- Speaker verification tasks
- Variable number of utterances per speaker
- Text-independent verification

**Training:**
```python
# GE2E loss:
# For each utterance, compute:
# - Centroid of other utterances from same speaker
# - Similarity to own centroid (positive)
# - Similarity to other speakers' centroids (negative)
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Designed for speaker verification (Google's approach)
- ✅ Handles variable utterances per speaker
- ✅ Natural few-shot learner
- ✅ Better calibration than prototypical

**Disadvantages:**
- ⚠️ Requires nPerSpeaker ≥ 3 for best results
- ⚠️ More computationally expensive

---

#### 3. **Angular Prototypical** (`angleproto.py`)
```yaml
trainfunc: angleproto
nPerSpeaker: 2
```

**How it Works:**
- Prototypical + angular margin
- Combines metric learning with angular constraints
- Better separation in embedding space

**Best for:**
- Balance between prototypical and angular margins
- Few-shot with better discrimination
